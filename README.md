# QuantumHoareLogic
Implentation of a Hoare-logic verification system for quantum programs embedded in Coq

The quantum Hoare logic formalized in this project is modelled after [[1]](#1). An analogue of Proposition 7.1 in that paper is proven in [QNL.v](theories/QNL.v).

Most work for this project was completed September 2019 - January 2020.
